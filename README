Run 'make' to compile, then execute ./scheme.  A required dependency
is the Boost.shared_ptr library.

This is an arithmetic Scheme interpreter, i.e. operations are
restricted to basic arithmetic.  Mostly adapted from the interpreter
presented in chapter 4 of SICP.

Available operations are: define set! + - / *

Example usage:
>(define x 2)
2
>(define y 5)
5
>(* x (* y (+ 5 x)))
70
>(set! x 5)
5
>(+ x y)
10

Type 'quit' at the prompt to exit.

Comments about the implementation are found in the source, mostly in
the header files.

Be careful as the REPL has no garbage collection implemented.
